# tomatoWater
Automatically water tomatoes (or any other plant) based on soil moisture. As i like to grow plants, but don't always have the time to water them, I came up with my own automated watering system. It consists of two moisture sensors, an aquarium water pump and an esp8266. If the moisture goes below an pre-defined value, the pump will be activated for a pre-defined time. It also features a webinterface to check the current values and trigger the watering.
The project was created using the sloeber ide.
